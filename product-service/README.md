# üõí Multivendor Microservice Application - Product Service

This repository is part of a **Multivendor Microservice Application** designed for seamless and scalable e-commerce operations. This specific service, **Product Service**, is implemented using **AWS Lambda** and **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)**, showcasing an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach for efficient cloud resource management.

### Key Components:
1. **AWS CDK**: 
   - Used to define the infrastructure and Lambda functions as code.
   - Enables reusability and consistency across deployments.

2. **Lambda Functions**:
   - Serve as the core microservices for handling product and category-related operations.
   - Highly scalable, event-driven functions with minimal cold start times.

3. **CloudFormation**:
   - Facilitates seamless provisioning and management of stacks, ensuring all resources are consistently deployed across the AWS environment.

4. **API Gateway**:
   - Exposes RESTful APIs for interacting with the Product and Category Services.
   - Acts as the entry point for managing product and category-related endpoints.

5. **ESBuild**:
   - Efficiently bundles and optimizes Lambda functions for production.

### Benefits:
- **Scalability**: Designed for high traffic with serverless technologies.
- **Resilience**: Ensures minimal downtime with distributed and fault-tolerant architecture.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Leverages AWS's pay-as-you-go model with Lambda.
